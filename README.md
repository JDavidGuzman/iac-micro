# Infrastructure as Code

This repository contains an executable file named start.sh, which will prompt a menu in order to show the options to select the infrastructure for the Kubernetes cluster. There are basically two environments, one for Virtual Box managed by vagrant; and another one for AWS Cloud managed by terraform. The Kubernetes Cluster in both cases will be set up with ansible using kubeadm admin tool, and the options for OS are between Centos 7 and Ubuntu Xenial. Docker is required in order to start the ansible container included in this code.

## Virtual Box option

As stated before, in order to run the Virtual Box option, vagrant is required: [click here for further information](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation).

Minimum two virtual machines will be required; one for a Master node and another one for a Worker node. There is the possibility to run a highly available cluster with multiple Master nodes; but this requires at least three master nodes for the control plane besides the selected number of worker nodes; this in order to achieve a fault tolerance of at least one master node due to the Quorum needed on the RAFT protocol used by Kubernetes for leader election; thus an Nginx with a layer 4 load balancer configuration will be initiated on a docker container. This feature was enabled just for recreational purposes, in its place I recommend running just one master and one worker. If a local setup of a multi-node control plane is really needed, I would recommend using [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/); a lighter implementation without virtual machines that means Kubernetes in Docker.
